Mooks Surf App is a full stack express app that allows users to log surfsopts and record indivisual surf sessions at those spots. 

For this project I used the Express framework with node.js mongoDb, Mongoose, JavaScript, HTML, and EJS

In the future I would like to build the ability for users to make profiles, and for other users to access their friends profiles to see their surfing data. In addition to this I would like to style the app.
